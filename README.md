# Web_Scrapping_Practice

I have used the website: http://books.toscrape.com/index.html and http://quotes.toscrape.com/which is specifically designed for people to scrape.
In the first file (Web Scraping), I have scraped the title of every book that has a 2-star rating.
In the second file (Web Scraping (Quotes)), I have scraped the names of the authors and quotes from the complete website.
